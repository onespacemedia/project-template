You asked us to reset your {{ settings.SITE_NAME }} password.

If you want to reset your password go to the link below.

Please note that this reset link will expire in 3 days.

Common login problems:

1. Only use the email address that is registered with {{ settings.SITE_NAME }} (that will be the one that this email has been sent to).
2. Double check the login details you are entering. Be careful when typing your email address and password as sometimes it's easy to mistype them especially on tablets and phones.
3. Close and restart your browser, and ideally clear your cache, cookies and history, before attempting to log in with your new password.
4. Check that any password managers that you are using are not automatically entering incorrect or outdated email addresses or passwords.

Thanks for using {{ settings.SITE_NAME }}.
